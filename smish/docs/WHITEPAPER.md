# Smish: Single-Action Microgateway for the Post-API Era

APIs served the client-server web.  
Smish serves **intent-native distributed systems**.

---

## 🌐 Core Thesis
Smish compresses the API contract into a **single-action semantic gateway**, reducing latency and negotiation overhead.  
A Smish node is not a service. It is a **signal reactor** that routes and resolves across fibers, without explicit schemas.

---

## 🔧 Node Capabilities
- Auto-discover and mesh with peers  
- Embed **quantized signals** for drift detection  
- Resolve control and data planes into a unified action  
- Self-heal using **canary-driven probes**  
- Cross-language adaptability: Python, Rust, Go, TypeScript, C++, JS  

---

## 📡 Why Now?
As agents replace human-centric clients, **traditional APIs collapse under the weight of schema, auth, and negotiation.**  
Smish is designed for the **post-API era**, where compressed semantic intents replace endpoints.

---

## 🔮 Hypothesis
We propose Smish as a candidate foundation for **post-API microgateways** in AI-native infrastructure.  
Here, agents and services no longer negotiate endpoints, but exchange **signals, intents, and fibers**.  

This makes Smish not just a tool — but a paradigm shift toward **sovereign, latencyless coordination**.
